## Notes

Please be aware this is a personal project and is still a work in progress. It is a project I did in my spare time to experiment. There are a few pages and functions that are not yet completed. For example the calendar and profile pages are still in progress.

Functionality that should work on iOS are:
- Register
- Login
- Add/edit and delete activities
- Upload image
- Logout

I haven't checked Android.

There is plenty I could add to improve this app and the codebase. Just to name a few:
- Tests - at the moment there are no tests
- Error handling
- Loading spinners
- Update interceptor to handle 401 authorization errors
- Environment variables

There's always room for improvement.

This works with https://github.com/nicfisher/saturday-api

Please note I'm definitely not a designer but I'm sure anyone will be able to see that :-)

Always open for feedback
